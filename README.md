## How was the workload divided
The project was co-created by Aapeli Huhtinen & Pinja Lalla. All aspects of HTML, CSS and JavaScript development were divided evenly. The project utilizes DOM manipulation and form validation without any external libraries.

## About The App
checkMate is a simple task manager application built with native JavaScript. Users can add tasks to list, mark them as completed and remove them from the list. The application features a counter that shows how many tasks have been completed. Users can rename the tasklist. The application checks inputs to ensure the tasks and list names meet minumum length requirements and provides user feedback with success or error messages in the allocated space.

## Screenshots

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following technologies: 
`html` for the basic structure and layout of the application
`css` for the application styling
`JavaScript` for DOM manipulation, task management and validation. No external libraries or frameworks were used.

## Setup
- download all the files and open index.html in your browser
- download or clone the repository

## Approach
The main focus of this project was to build a lightweight task manager using only native JavaScript. Key features include:

DOM manipulation to dynamically add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
Input validation to ensure meaningful task names and list titles.
CSS for providing feedback on valid or invalid inputs (e.g., red borders for invalid entries).
A task counter that updates in real-time based on the user's actions.
The possibility to rename the task list.
The project follows good coding practices with separation of concerns, ensuring that CSS and JavaScript are in external files.

## Status
checkMate is still in progress. Future updates may include: 
- LocalStorage to save tasks between sessions
- Improved user experiencewith drag-and-drop reordering of tasks
- Enhanced responsiveness for mobile devices

## Credits
- Aapeli Huhtinen - design and implementation 
- Pinja Lalla - design and implementation

This project was also developed with the assistance of ChatGPT for code structuring and improvement. ChatGPT helped generate ideas for input validation and overall app structure, which improved the quality and efficiency of the project. Every line of code is written by the developers and chatGPT was only used for ideas for improvements.
